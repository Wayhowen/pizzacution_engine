# pizzacution_engine

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
We did not know how to fix the naming issue in the project, and so the project `org.mdse.minisql.query.interpreter.eclipse` (connects interpreter to runtime eclipse instance) which is inside the Development folder is not named according to the `pizzacution.[name]` convention. This is also left as an exercise for the reader, if they wish to fix that they are more than welcome to!
