# pizzacution_engine

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
We did not know how to fix the naming issue in the project, and so the project `org.mdse.minisql.query.interpreter.eclipse` (connects interpreter to runtime eclipse instance) which is inside the Development folder is not named according to the `pizzacution.[name]` convention. This is also left as an exercise for the reader, if they wish to fix that they are more than welcome to!

Furthermore, the two projects, namely `pizzacution.query.validation` and `pizzacution.query.interpreter` are outside of Development folder. This could probably be fixed easily, but we didn't work to fix this, so that we would not introduce any new issues by mistake. Hopefully, that isn't a problem, those two projects should be imported into the Development environment.
