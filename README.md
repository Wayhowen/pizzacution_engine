# pizzacution_engine

## IMPORTANT NOTES:
We did not know how to fix the naming issue in the project, and so the project `org.mdse.minisql.query.interpreter.eclipse` (connects interpreter to runtime eclipse instance) 
which is inside the Development folder is not named according to the `pizzacution.[name]` convention (it is called like that inside eclipse, but not outside for some reason).
 This is also left as an exercise for the reader, if they wish to fix
 that they are more than welcome to!
